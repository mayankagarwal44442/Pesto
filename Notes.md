	+ store.js
		+	createStore() creates a Redux store that holds the complete state tree of your app. There should only be a single 	  store in your app.
		+	Reducers are pure functions that specify how application state should change in response to an action. Reducers 	respond with the new state, which is passed to our store and, in turn, our UI.

	+ 	Reducers
		+ 	Auth Reducer - Basically handles the cases where an error occurs in the authorization and how the state tree has 	 to be reloaded.
		+	Error Reducer : Returns the payload for an invalid response.
		+ 	Combine oth the auth and error reducers to one using  the root reducer in index.js

	+ 	Utils
		+ 	AuthHandler.js
			+ Validates the token
			+ Sends the auth Header stating that the token is valid or not
			+ As to whether login should be permitted or not.

		As for the exports in some modules
		export default connect(
  		mapStateToProps,
  		{ registerUser }
		)(withRouter(Register));

		+ connect : connects our React components to our Redux store provided by the Provider component
		+ We need to ise with router in order to redirect inside an action 
		+ this.props.history.push('/dashboard') - This does not work in actions
		+ mapStateToProps allows us to get our state from Redux and map it to props which we can use inside components.
		+  export 
			const mapStateToProps = state => ({
  			auth: state.auth,
  			errors: state.errors
			});
			We get our redux reducers by using mapstatetoprops
		+	This allows us to call this.props.auth or this.props.errors within our Register component.
		+	We use a proptypes constructor	
			Register.propTypes = {
  			registerUser: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  			auth: PropTypes.object.isRequired,
  			errors: PropTypes.object.isRequired
			};

		+ Register.proptypes : This is how we recieve without any props neing passed
		+ Because all that is ahndled by redux which is used for state management

	+	private-route 
		+	Created inorder to make sure user is authenticated before he accesses a website.
		+	Controls the passing of props
